# 100-days-of-code
Challenge accepted: I will code every day for at least 1 hour a day for 100 days in a row!
The projects that I work on will either be in this folder or other repositories which will be logged by my git commits.
I am also working on an app which will be private so you may not be able to see all of my projects but keep checking in for my latest projects. Happy coding
